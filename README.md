# Burger Handlebars Application
  

# Burger Guidelines

This is a a [Heroku](../04-Supplemental/HerokuGuide.md) deployed Express.js Handlebars application that allows the user to create a list of burgers that can be listed as waiting to be eaten or devoured. The client requires an application that can move a created item from one list to another.The application will be invoked with the following command:

```

node server.js

```

The specific features of the application are outlined in the acceptance criteria provided by the client. 

# Acceptance Criteria Requirements:

Functional application includes the following:

* Functional application that creates and updates a burger to specified lists (Waiting to Be Eaten vs. Devoured).

* Application users are able to add the names of burgers they'd like to eat to a list.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

 
The following animation demonstrates the client's request for application functionality:
